## svn比较本地副本修改内容

```
svn diff
```

![svn diff](http://7xlbo3.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/2016/12/14/20161214112527.png)

可以指定diff客户端

```
svn diff --diff-cmd=meld
```

![svn diff meld](http://7xlbo3.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/2016/12/14/20161214112724.png)

也可以直接修改svn配置文件`~/.subversion/config`中`diff-cmd`选项,这样就不用每次都输入参数了

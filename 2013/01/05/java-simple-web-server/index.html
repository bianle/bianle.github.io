		<p>This is the window that comes up when you run the program, just a little motivator so you can see what��s in the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>Note to get the maximum out of this tutorial it is recommended that you have a basic grasp on how HTTP works. If the little man inside your head says what tha H is HTTP, you should go to the bottom and check some of the pointers. There you will find some nice text to explain the basic concept.</p>
<p>Let��s get started!<br>When making a program nowadays the first thing you should think about is the GUI (graphical user interface). If the program dosen��t look fancy, you can just press all the cancel buttons on the project. Ok that was meant as a joke, but there is some truth in it. People tend to judge a program a lot on its look, even though the real coding job is in making the stuff that goes on behind the scenes.</p>
<p>The good news is that we are making this in Java, and since Java is such a friendly programming language it��s real easy to get some interface going. Comments are in green.</p>
<p>//file: webserver_starter.java<br>//declare a class wich inherit JFrame<br>public classwebserver_starter<br>extendsJFrame {<br>//declare some panel, scrollpanel, textarea for gui<br>JPanel jPanel1 = newJPanel();<br>JScrollPane jScrollPane1 = newJScrollPane();<br>JTextArea jTextArea2 = newJTextArea();<br>staticInteger listen_port = null;<br>//basic class constructor<br>publicwebserver_starter() {<br>try{<br>jbInit();<br>}<br>catch(Exception e) {<br>e.printStackTrace();<br>}<br>}<br>//the JavaAPI entry point<br>//where it starts this class if run<br>public staticvoidmain(String[] args) {<br>//start server on port x, default 80<br>//use argument to main for what port to start on<br>try{<br>listen_port = newInteger(args[0]);<br>//catch parse error<br>}<br>catch(Exception e) {<br>listen_port = newInteger(80);<br>}<br>//create an instance of this class<br>webserver_starter webserver = newwebserver_starter();<br>}<br>//set up the user interface<br>privatevoidjbInit() throwsException {<br>//oh the pretty colors<br>jTextArea2.setBackground(newColor(16, 12, 66));<br>jTextArea2.setForeground(newColor(151, 138, 255));<br>jTextArea2.setBorder(BorderFactory.createLoweredBevelBorder());<br>jTextArea2.setToolTipText(“”);<br>jTextArea2.setEditable(false);<br>jTextArea2.setColumns(30);<br>jTextArea2.setRows(15);<br>//change this to impress your friends<br>this.setTitle(“Jon��s fancy prancy webserver”);<br>//ugly inline listener, it��s for handling closing of the window<br>this.addWindowListener(newjava.awt.event.WindowAdapter() {<br>publicvoidwindowClosing(WindowEvent e) {<br>this_windowClosed(e);<br>}<br>});<br>//add the various to the proper containers<br>jScrollPane1.getViewport().add(jTextArea2);<br>jPanel1.add(jScrollPane1);<br>this.getContentPane().add(jPanel1, BorderLayout.EAST);<br>//tveak the apearance<br>this.setVisible(true);<br>this.setSize(420, 350);<br>this.setResizable(false);<br>//make sure it is drawn<br>this.validate();<br>//create the actual serverstuff,<br>//all that is implemented in another class<br>newserver(listen_port.intValue(), this);<br>}<br>//exit program when “X” is pressed.<br>voidthis_windowClosed(WindowEvent e) {<br>System.exit(1);<br>}<br>//this is a method to get messages from the actual<br>//server to the window<br>publicvoidsend_message_to_window(String s) {<br>jTextArea2.append(s);<br>}<br>} //class end</p>
<p>In a nutshell this code sets up the window and makes everything look good. If you look at the picture of the program on top of this page. This code makes that!</p>
<p>Ok, enough time wasted on the look. Lets get down with the fun stuff, making the actual httpserver.</p>
<p>//file: server.java<br>//the real (http) serverclass<br>//it extends thread so the server is run in a different<br>//thread than the gui, that is to make it responsive.<br>//it��s really just a macho coding thing.<br>public classserver<br>extendsThread {<br>//the constructor method<br>//the parameters it takes is what port to bind to, the default tcp port<br>//for a httpserver is port 80. the other parameter is a reference to<br>//the gui, this is to pass messages to our nice interface<br>publicserver(intlisten_port, webserver_starter to_send_message_to) {<br>message_to = to_send_message_to;<br>port = listen_port;<br>//this makes a new thread, as mentioned before,it��s to keep gui in<br>//one thread, server in another. You may argue that this is totally<br>//unnecessary, but we are gonna have this on the web so it needs to<br>//be a bit macho! Another thing is that real pro webservers handles<br>//each request in a new thread. This server dosen��t, it handles each<br>//request one after another in the same thread. This can be a good<br>//assignment!! To redo this code so that each request to the server<br>//is handled in its own thread. The way it is now it blocks while<br>//one client access the server, ex if it transferres a big file the<br>//client have to wait real long before it gets any response.<br>this.start();<br>}<br>privatevoids(String s2) { //an alias to avoid typing so much!<br>message_to.send_message_to_window(s2);<br>}<br>privatewebserver_starter message_to;

<p>BEWARE! When you run the web server you are potentially opening for all your files to be red by the entire Internet! The httpserver is only ment to be used for testing. If you absoulutely want to run this httpserver for longer periods of time; consider creating a new user with only read access to the files you want to share and running it only with this user!</p>
<p>Download the tutorial files! this zipfile contains both sourcecode and compiled javabytecode files. So you can test the program without having the javacompiler. It also contains a sample index.html and a jpg file.</p>
<p>How to run the program? Get into commandline, cd to the dir where you extracted the files (webserver_starter.class and the other files). Then type: java webserver_starter</p>
<p>Then the window you see on top of this page should pop up. To test if this httpserver is really functioning, you open your browser, and in the location line you type: <a href="http://localhost/index.html" target="_blank" rel="external">http://localhost/index.html</a> ,this will bring up a sample html file that is in the zipfile.</p>
<p>If you want to test the httpserver from another machine on the Internet, then you need to know the ip-address or hostname the httpserver is running on, then you type that in the location line in the browser, like <a href="http://123.123.123.123/index.html" target="_blank" rel="external">http://123.123.123.123/index.html</a> .Note, it may not work if you are behind a firewall or a NAT router, but that��s not the programs�� fault!</p>
<p>Update: Oct 2011. This code is not actively updated, but I changed a few things mainly due to many people are referencing this. The switch (file_type) was missing breaks. requestedfile.read() and output.write() now reads and writes a byte array which speeds things up. And added favicon support since somebody asked about it.</p>
<p>How to compile: Open command line. cd to directory where you unpacked it. javac *.java<br>How to run: Open command line. cd to directory where you unpacked it. java -cp . webserver_starter</p>
<p>Pointers to related stuff on the hypertext transfer protocol (http) and web servers:</p>
<p>HowStuffWorks This is a very basic introduction for the novice on how web servers works. Has also other text about Internet and Routers, in easy to understandable language. Nice if you are starting out learning.</p>
<p>HTTP Made Really Easy Here is some nice text that goes through the main points in HTTP. A little more technical. It��s recommended that you know these things to understand the above tutorial.<br>Apache the best and most widely used web server on the Internet today, check it out. If you want to run your own web server this is the one to get, you can get binaries for both Windows and Unix. You can download the entire sourcecode if you want to check how it was made.</p>
<p>Mozilla / Netscape is a nice web browser. Get rid of the Explorer, there are some rumors that Internet Explorer secretly collects all the pages you are visiting and sends it to microsoft.com.</p>
<p>RFC-1945 RFC describing Hypertext Transfer Protocol �� HTTP/1.0</p>
<p>RFC-2616 RFC describing Hypertext Transfer Protocol �� HTTP/1.1</p>
<p>RFC webpage The Request For Comment webpage, RFC are technical documents describing all sorts of protocols on the Internet.</p>
